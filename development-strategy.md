# Even-or-odd-object: development strategy

Building this site one step at a time

## 0. Setup

> * `index.html`: basic layout and references to external files
> * `style.css`: css style attributes of the HTML elements

## 1. Data & Log

> * `string-sorter.js` and `log.js`
> * Create the main object to store the state and behavior of the webpage.

## 2. Init

> * `init.js` and `string-sorter.js`
> * Create the renderActiveList function inside the `stringSorter` object to display the list on screen with the initial values when the page finish to load.

## 3. User Story: Set Active

__A user can select which list of strings to display on the screen__

> * which files of code do you need to change?
> * what are you changing in them?

## 4. User Story: Add String

__A user can add a string to the String Sorter. The string is properly sorted and the active list is re-rendered (if it was changed)__

> * which files of code do you need to change?
> * what are you changing in them?

## 5. User Story: Reset

__A user can set the state and DOM back to it's initial values__

> * which files of code do you need to change?
> * what are you changing in them?
